# Feature-User Story Mapping for TODO Generation
# Generated by odoo-project-sync v1.1.7
#
# STRUCTURE:
# - Features: Business capabilities that will become Knowledge articles
# - User Stories: User-facing work items with component lists
# - Components: String references with model qualification
#   - Fields: type.model.name format (e.g., field.sale_order.x_credit_limit)
#   - Views: type.model.name format (e.g., view.product_product.Product List)
#   - Actions: type.model.name format (e.g., server_action.sale_order.[rwx] Validate)
#   - Automations: type.model.name format (e.g., automation.account_move.Auto-post)
#   - Reports: type.model.name format (e.g., report.sale_order.Sales Summary)
#   - Fallback: type.name format if model not available
#
# EDITING:
# - Review user story descriptions
# - Add/remove/regroup components as needed
# - User stories should represent actual work breakdown
# - Components in 'Unassigned Components' should be reassigned
