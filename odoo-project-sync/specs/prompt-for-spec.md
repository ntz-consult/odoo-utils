# File Analysis and Refactoring Specification and Plan

## Purpose

This specification outlines the process for analyzing the file in context (attached), seeking clarifications if needed, and refactoring its content into a structured specification and plan document.

## Scope

- Analysis of file content
- Clarification gathering (if necessary)
- Refactoring the markdown file in context (attached) into specification and plan format
- Documentation ONLY (NO CODE IMPLEMENTATION)

## Inputs

- The markdown file in context (attached)

## Outputs

- The markdown file in context (attached file)
- Restructured and containing the final specification and plan, which must include a list of potential source files involved in the proposed specification

## Process Steps

### 1. File Analysis

- Read and understand the current content of the file
- Identify the core concepts, requirements, and structure
- Determine if the content represents raw instructions, requirements, or existing specifications

### 2. Clarification Phase

- Identify any ambiguous, incomplete, or unclear elements in the file
- Ask targeted clarifying questions to stakeholders if uncertainties exist
- Document assumptions made during analysis

### 3. Refactoring Process

- Transform raw content into structured specification format
- Organize information into logical sections (Purpose, Scope, Inputs, Outputs, etc.)
- Create a clear, actionable plan with defined steps
- Ensure the specification is comprehensive yet concise
- Include a list of potential source files involved in the proposed specification

### 4. Validation

- Review the refactored specification for completeness
- Ensure all original requirements are addressed
- Verify the plan is logical and executable
- Confirm the list of potential source files is accurate and relevant

### 5. Documentation

- Write the final specification and plan to the target file
- Replace existing content with the structured document

## Constraints

- No code implementation is permitted
- Only the final specification and plan shall be written to the file
- Maintain the integrity of original requirements while improving structure

## Success Criteria

- File content is transformed from raw instructions to structured specification
- All process steps are clearly defined
- Document is professional, clear, and actionable
- No implementation artifacts are included
- The final specification and plan includes a comprehensive list of potential source files
